# Java-Photo-Library
The application should allow you to assign a title to your photos as well as "tags". Each photo has a date and a detailed description. It is possible to sort photos into named collections (the same photo may belong to many collections), search for photos by "tags" (also several - ANDed or ORed). It is also possible to add and remove photos.
